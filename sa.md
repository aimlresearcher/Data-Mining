# 🧠 Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis 

## 📝 Outline of Steps

1. 📁 **Define a small dataset**  
   - Include labeled **positive** and **negative** sentences.

2. 🔧 **Preprocess the text**  
   - Convert text to **lowercase**  
   - Remove **stopwords**  
   - Apply **lemmatization**

3. 🧰 **Build the vocabulary**  
   - Create a set of all unique words from the dataset.

4. 📊 **Calculate word frequencies**  
   - Count word occurrences in **positive** and **negative** sentences separately.

5. 🧮 **Apply Laplace smoothing**  
   - Avoid zero probabilities by adding smoothing to frequency counts.

6. 📉 **Calculate prior probabilities**  
   - Compute the probability of each class:  
     $( P(\text{Positive}) )$, $( P(\text{Negative}) )$

7. 📐 **Calculate likelihood**  
   - For a given test sentence, calculate $( P(X \mid \text{class}) )$

8. 🧾 **Compute posterior probabilities**  
   - Use Bayes' Theorem:  
     $( P(\text{class} \mid X) \propto P(\text{class}) \times P(X \mid \text{class}) )$

9. 🏁 **Classify the test sentence**  
   - Choose the class with the **highest posterior probability**

## 📈 4. Word Frequencies by Sentiment

| 🧩 Word       | 😊 Count in Positive | 😠 Count in Negative |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| love         | 1                    | 0                    |
| amazing      | 1                    | 0                    |

🧮 **Total words in Positive class** = **6**  
🧮 **Total words in Negative class** = **9**


---

## 🧮 5. Apply Laplace Smoothing

### 📐 Laplace Smoothing Formula:

$P(w \mid \text{class}) = \frac{\text{count}(w) + 1}{\text{total words in class} + |V|}$

Where:
- `count(w)` = frequency of the word in the given class
- `|V|` = vocabulary size (in our case, **13**)
- `total words in class` = total number of words in that class  
  - Positive = **6**
  - Negative = **9**

---
## ⚖️ 6. Prior Probabilities

To calculate prior probabilities, we use:

- 📊 **Total examples** = 5  
- 😊 **Positive examples** = 2  
- 😠 **Negative examples** = 3  

### 📌 Prior Probability Formula:

$P(\text{Positive}) = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \quad , \quad P(\text{Negative}) = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6$

### 💬 Original Sentence:
> "Amazing and exciting movie"

### 🧹 After Preprocessing:

## 📊 8. Likelihoods with Laplace Smoothing

We compute the likelihoods $( P(X \mid \text{class}) )$ using the **Laplace smoothing formula** for each word in the test sentence:  
**"amazing, exciting, movie"**

---

### 😊 P(X | Positive):

| 🧩 Word    | 🔢 Count in Positive | 🔍 P(w \| Positive)                             |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| amazing   | 1                    | $( \frac{1+1}{6+13} = \frac{2}{19} \approx 0.105 )$ |
| exciting  | 1                    | $( \frac{2}{19} \approx 0.105 )$             |
| movie     | 1                    | $( \frac{2}{19} \approx 0.105 )$              |

$P(X \mid \text{Positive}) = 0.105 \times 0.105 \times 0.105 \approx 0.001157625$

---

### 😠 P(X | Negative):

| 🧩 Word    | 🔢 Count in Negative | 🔍 P(w \| Negative)                             |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| amazing   | 0                    | $( \frac{0+1}{9+13} = \frac{1}{22} \approx 0.0455 )$ |
| exciting  | 0                    | $( \frac{1}{22} \approx 0.0455 )$             |
| movie     | 1                    | $( \frac{1+1}{22} = \frac{2}{22} \approx 0.0909 )$ |

$P(X \mid \text{Negative}) = 0.0455 \times 0.0455 \times 0.0909 \approx 0.0001883$

---
## 🧠 9. Posterior Probabilities

We use the full formula to calculate posterior probabilities:

### 📐 Formula:
$P(\text{class} \mid X) = P(\text{class}) \times P(X \mid \text{class})$

---

### 😊 Positive Class:

$P(\text{Positive} \mid X) = 0.4 \times 0.001157625 \approx 0.00046305$

---

### 😠 Negative Class:

$P(\text{Negative} \mid X) = 0.6 \times 0.0001883 \approx 0.00011298$

---

### ✅ Final Decision:

Since:

$P(\text{Positive} \mid X) > P(\text{Negative} \mid X)$

🔍 **The test sentence is classified as: `Positive`**
