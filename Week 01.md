# 📊 01-Why Data Mining?

---

### 🧨 The Explosive Growth of Data  
From **terabytes to petabytes**

---

### 🛠 Data Collection & Availability  
- Automated data collection tools  
- Database systems  
- The Web  
- A fully digitized society

---

### 🌐 Sources of Abundant Data  
- **Business**: Web, e-commerce, transactions, stock data  
- **Science**: Remote sensing, bioinformatics, simulations  
- **Society**: News, digital cameras, YouTube

---

### ❗️ The Big Problem  
> “We are drowning in data but starving for knowledge!”

---

### 💡 The Invention  
> “Necessity is the mother of invention”  
➡️ **Data Mining** = Automated analysis of massive data

# ❓ 02-What is Data Mining?

---

### 🔹 Definition

**Data mining** (also called **knowledge discovery from data**) is the process of:

> Extracting **interesting**, **non-trivial**, **implicit**, **previously unknown**, and **potentially useful** patterns or knowledge from large amounts of data.

---

### 🔹 Characteristics of the Patterns

- **Interesting** – provides valuable insights  
- **Non-trivial** – not obvious or straightforward  
- **Implicit** – hidden in the data  
- **Previously unknown** – not known beforehand  
- **Potentially useful** – applicable in real-world decisions

---

### 🔹 Alternative Names

- Knowledge Discovery in Databases (**KDD**)  
- Knowledge Extraction  
- Data/Pattern Analysis  
- Data Archeology  
- Data Dredging  
- Information Harvesting  
- Business Intelligence

---

### 🔹 What Data Mining is *Not*

> ❌ Not all data-related tasks qualify as data mining.

Examples:

- **Simple search** or **query processing** (e.g., SQL queries)  
- **Deductive expert systems** using predefined rules

---

### 🧠 Summary

Data mining focuses on **discovering hidden, valuable insights** in large datasets — not just retrieving known facts.

> **Data mining** is the **core** of the **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)** process.

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. ### 🗄️ **Databases (Raw Data Sources)**
   - Data originates from various sources like relational databases, data lakes, or logs.

2. ### 🧹 **Data Cleaning**
   - Removes noise, corrects inconsistencies, and fills missing values.

3. ### 🔗 **Data Integration**
   - Merges data from multiple sources into a unified **Data Warehouse**.

4. ### 🏢 **Data Warehouse**
   - A central repository for storing cleaned and integrated data.

5. ### 🎯 **Selection**
   - Extracts **task-relevant data** based on what needs to be analyzed.

6. ### 💡 **Data Mining**
   - The **core process** that applies algorithms to discover **patterns**, **associations**, or **rules** within the data.

7. ### 📊 **Pattern Evaluation**
   - Evaluates and filters patterns using interestingness measures (e.g., relevance, novelty).

8. ### 🧠 **Knowledge**
   - The final outcome: validated, actionable insights ready for decision-making or further use.

---

### 🧠 Key Insight:

> While **data mining** is at the heart of KDD, its effectiveness depends on **the entire pipeline**—from data preparation to evaluation.
