# 📊 01-Understanding Objects and Attributes in a Dataset

### 🏷️ **Objects (Instances/Records):**
- Each **row** in the table represents an **instance** of data (i.e., a taxpayer). 👨‍💼👩‍💼  
- These instances are labeled as **Tid** (Transaction ID) from **1 to 10**. 🔢  

### 📌 **Attributes (Features):**
Each **column** represents an **attribute** of the dataset, describing different characteristics of the objects. The attributes are:

- **Refund:** Whether the person is eligible for a tax refund (**Yes/No**) 💰✅❌  
- **Marital Status:** The individual's marital status (**Single, Married, Divorced**) 💍  
- **Taxable Income:** The person's taxable income (**e.g., 125K, 100K, etc.**) 💵  
- **Cheat:** The **target attribute**, indicating whether the person has cheated on taxes (**Yes/No**) 🚨🔴

### 🎯 **Purpose of the Slide:**
- This dataset is commonly used for **classification tasks** in **Machine Learning** 🤖📊.  
- It helps predict **whether a person cheats on taxes** based on their **refund status, marital status, and taxable income**.  
- The table visually distinguishes **features (attributes) 📊** from **instances (objects) 🏷️**, making it easier to understand **data representation** in a structured format.  

🚀 **This dataset is a great example of how structured data can be used for predictive analytics!**  

# 🔢 **02-Levels of Data Measurement**


### 🔹 **Nominal Scale (Categorical) 🏷️**
- Used for **categorization** without any **order or ranking**.
- Examples: **Gender (Male, Female), Colors (Red, Blue, Green), Nationality (American, Indian, Chinese)** 🌎🎨  

### 🔹 **Ordinal Scale (Ordered Categories) 📶**
- Data is arranged in a **meaningful order** but the differences between values are **not uniform**.
- Examples: **Movie Ratings (1⭐ to 5⭐), Education Level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)** 🎓🎥  

### 🔹 **Interval Scale (Equal Intervals, No True Zero) 📏**
- Differences between values are **meaningful**, but there is **no true zero**.
- Examples: **Temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit 🌡️, IQ Scores 🧠, Dates (2000, 2020, 2050) 📅**  

### 🔹 **Ratio Scale (Equal Intervals with True Zero) 🔢**
- Includes all properties of **interval scale**, but **has a true zero**.
- Examples: **Height 📏, Weight ⚖️, Age ⏳, Income 💵**  

---

## 📌 **Summary Table:**
| 🔢 Scale Type | ✅ Order | 🔄 Equal Intervals | 🎯 True Zero | 📌 Examples |
|--------------|---------|----------------|----------|------------|
| 🏷️ **Nominal**  | ❌ No   | ❌ No   | ❌ No  | Gender, Colors, Nationality |
| 📶 **Ordinal**  | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No   | ❌ No  | Movie Ratings, Education Level |
| 📏 **Interval** | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ❌ No  | Temperature, IQ, Dates |
| 🔢 **Ratio**    | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes  | ✅ Yes | Height, Weight, Age, Income |

---

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways:**
- **Nominal** → **Labels only** (No order) 🏷️  
- **Ordinal** → **Order matters, but differences are not meaningful** 📶  
- **Interval** → **Equal differences, but no true zero** 🌡️  
- **Ratio** → **Equal differences + True zero exists** 🔢  

🚀 **Understanding these levels is crucial for selecting the right statistical methods!**
